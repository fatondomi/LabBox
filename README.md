LabBox - Here are all the files you need and everything you need to know about it

When installing Labboxuino on Windows 7 :

if install_labbox.exe doesn't run because it requires .NET framework
  
  --> install .NET 4.7.2 from ninite.com 
      or from this github page (find it listed together with install_labbox.exe)
  
  --> try running install_labbox.exe again
